# Bitcoin is for Artists

I fell down the Bitcoin rabbit hole in 2017. Before that I was singing songs for a living, spending my time between New York, Nashville and Los Angeles chasing a dream. My goal for this post is to present what I feel is the most beneficial knowledge I have gained since then. If I can provide a single fellow artist with a better understanding of the merits of Bitcoin I'll be happy.

<!-- ## Scarcity -->

Almost everyone is familiar with how an items perceived scarcity will cause demand for it to increase, which in turn causes the price to do the same. Think of tickets for a sold-out concert as an example. Take a second to think of another example... Anyone think of money? Or more specifically, fiat currencies? I’m gonna guess not many of you did. If you asked me a few years ago I would have probably rhymed off 100 different physical items before even thinking about euros, dollars or pesos. Bitcoin fundamentally changed how I think about money. I'll explain...

<!-- ## Inflation -->

Inflation can be defined as the

> _”quantitative measure of the rate at which the average price level of a basket of selected goods and services in an economy increases over a period of time”_ ([src](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp)).

In other words, inflation is a measure of the decline in purchasing power of your currency over time. When I first visited New York is 2011 I recall that the price of an espresso at my favorite coffee shop was two dollars and 25 cents. I bought one a few weeks ago for four dollars and 50 cents. I’m pretty sure it would have been impossible to ask a 2011 New Yorker to pay over four dollars for a coffee. The reality is that one dollar is not worth as much as it was then. When I think back to my high-school economics classes I have to say that this idea generally sums up what I learned about the phenomenon. What I don't remember learning is the causes of inflation.

> _“The consensus view among economists is that sustained inflation occurs when a nation's money supply growth outpaces economic growth.“_ ([src](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp))

<!-- ## Supply -->

Who is responsible for a nations money supply growth? That would be the Central Banks. One way that Central Banks increase supply is via a process called Quantitative Easing, often abbreviated as QE.

> _“To execute quantitative easing, central banks increase the supply of money by buying government bonds and other securities."_ ([src](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quantitative-easing.asp))

QE is just a fancy way of describing the process of printing money (increasing the supply) to purchase things like government debt. We saw this process begin all around the world as a response to the global financial crisis in [2008](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/24/the-fed-launched-qe-nine-years-ago--these-four-charts-show-its-impact.html) and again more [recently](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/15/federal-reserve-cuts-rates-to-zero-and-launches-massive-700-billion-quantitative-easing-program.html).

<!-- ## Cantillon Effect -->

My journey down the rabbit hole continued when I learned of the Cantillon Effect...

> _"The redistributive effects of money creation were called Cantillon effects by Mark Blaug after the Franco-Irish economist Richard Cantillon who experienced the effect of inflation under the paper money system of John Law at the beginning of the 18th century. Cantillon explained that The first ones to receive the newly created money see their incomes rise whereas the last ones to receive the newly created money see their purchasing power decline as consumer price inflation comes about."_ ([src](https://mises.org/library/how-central-banking-increased-inequality))

Those closest to the printing press will benefit. Everyone else, the overwhelming majority of the population, will suffer. I graduated from university in 2008. I remember the talk of plans being drawn up to bail out the banks. These private entities had enjoyed all the upside during the good times and then simply handed over all the downside to the public. Privatize the gains, socialize the losses. People [protested](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/27/ireland-bailout-angry-demonstrators-dublin), but it made no difference. The printing began, and inflation followed. I remember this [clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koY6kXhQDQo) surfacing shortly after that time. Now I better understand why this guy was so angry.

<!-- ## 21 million -->

How did Bitcoin compel me to examine money through the lens of topics like scarcity, supply growth and the Cantillon Effect? The moment I realized that Bitcoin was a radical experiment to create a new form of money; one that is scarce by design. On January 3rd 2009, publicly verifiable code was executed for the first time to generate a new digital currency with a fixed supply schedule of 21 million. [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto), the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, chose this number as a hard cap limit and paired it with a system to programmatically create the coins over time. An encrypted message to was later found among the first batch of transactions that read,

Since launch, the Bitcoin network has been doing its thing in a distributed fashion to ensure that there is no single point of failure. There is a whole bunch of technical brilliance at play to ensure that the network stays functioning as intended, but all you need to know is that it works. As I write this there is currently over 18 million Bitcoin in existence, and roughly every ten minutes the network autonomously generates some more - all in line with the schedule that was laid out by Satoshi.

There is no central bank. Nor is there lobbyists or politicians that can lean on the central bankers to influence the supply. The schedule is predetermined, and verifiable.

If you are thinking to yourself _"What is stopping those who maintain and update the Bitcoin code from changing the supply schedule?"_ Good question, and the answer is nothing. The figure of 21 million is a social contract of sorts. Satoshi published the code with an open-source [license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) that permits anyone to copy (or "fork") the innovation and create their own digital currency. Many have. A quick glance at the [repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) where the code is hosted shows that it has been forked many thousand times. Like any open-source project, changes have been made to the code as the years have passed, however the fixed supply schedule laid out by Satoshi remains the same. As it stands there will only ever be 21 million Bitcoins in existence. A network effect has taken hold around this vision. It is this implementation that remains by far and away the most popular in terms of [invested capital](https://messari.io/asset/bitcoin).

Enthusiasts emphasize that Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that is:

- permission-less
- censorship-resistant
- Unseizable

<!-- ## A Hedge -->

While all of this is true, many of us (at least not yet) have never experienced problems with censorship of payments. I feel very fortunate to have never struggled to open a bank account. But some people have. So it is important to remember that Bitcoin is different things for different people, and that is why it has appeal to so many. I like to think of Bitcoin as a hedge against fiat currency devaluation. It provides a way to opt-out of the currently established forms of money. It is a bet of sorts; one that could potentially be the greatest asymmetric opportunity in history.

If history is anything to go by, we should be aware that central banks will usually find a reason to increase the supply of fiat currencies. Whether it is bailing out failed businesses or funding another war, the value of your savings is at the mercy of a small group of people with little to no oversight. I used to believe that institutions like governments and banks would do bad things because they were evil. As I have gotten older I tend to put it down to plain old incompetence. There are many [examples](https://listverse.com/2012/12/26/10-fascinating-economic-collapses-through-history/) of such behavior leading to the fall of widely adopted currencies. It begs the question, why would it not happen again?

Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, was asked if the fed was _"essentially flooding the system with money"_, he agreed and said:

By simply allocating a percentage of my savings into Bitcoin I like to think that I am purchasing an insurance policy. Some like to trade Bitcoin, but I prefer to just hold. I find this long-term investment approach to be a comforting juxtaposition to the short-sighted antics of those at the helm of traditional currencies. For as long as the hard cap of 21 million is in place, I will hold. Bitcoin is still an experiment. It may fail, and you should only ever invest a sum of money that you are willing to lose. The rabbit hole has been a long and winding road with many articles, documentaries and books consumed. Here is some further reading that I highly recommend:

- [Bitcoin white paper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) - Penned by Satoshi. Where I started, and so should you.
- [The Bitcoin Standard](https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Standard-Decentralized-Alternative-Central/dp/1119473861) - A great book that helped me understand better the history of money.
- [Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder](https://www.amazon.com/Antifragile-Things-That-Disorder-Incerto/dp/0812979680/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1590511162&sr=1-1) - Where I learned about the idea of asymmetric opportunities.
