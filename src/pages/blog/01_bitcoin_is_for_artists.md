# Bitcoin is for Artists

I fell down the Bitcoin rabbit hole in 2017. Before that I was singing songs for a living, spending my time between New York, Nashville and Los Angeles chasing a dream. My goal for this post is to present what I feel is the most important knowledge I have gained since then. If I can provide a single fellow artist with a better understanding of the merits of Bitcoin I'll be happy.

<!-- ## Scarcity -->

Almost everyone is familiar with how scarcity of an item will cause demand to increase, which will in turn cause the price to do the same. Think of tickets for a sold-out concert as an example. Take a second to think of another example... Anyone think of money? Or more specifically, fiat currencies? I’m gonna guess not many of you did. If you asked me a few years ago I would have probably rhymed off 100 different physical items before even thinking about euros, dollars or pesos. Bitcoin fundamentally changed how I think about money. I'll explain...

<!-- ## Inflation -->

Inflation can be defined as the

In other words, inflation is a measure of the decline in purchasing power of your currency over time. When I first visited New York is 2011 I recall that the price of an espresso at my favorite coffee shop was $2.25. I bought one a few weeks ago for $4.50. I can’t say for certain, but I’m pretty sure it would have been impossible to ask a 2011 New Yorker to pay \$4.50 for a coffee. The reality is that one dollar is not worth as much as it was then. When I think back to my high-school economics classes I have to say that this general observation pretty much sums up what I understood about the phenomenon. However I didn't happen to retain what actually causes inflation.

<!-- ## Supply -->

Who is responsible for a nations money supply growth? That would be the Central Banks. One way that Central Banks increase supply is via a process called Quantitative Easing, often abbreviated as QE.

> _“To execute quantitative easing, central banks increase the supply of money by buying government bonds and other securities."_ ([src](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quantitative-easing.asp))

QE is just a fancy way of describing the process of printing money (increasing the supply) to purchase things like government debt. We saw this process begin all around the world as a response to the global financial crisis in [2008](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/24/the-fed-launched-qe-nine-years-ago--these-four-charts-show-its-impact.html). The process was ramped up again more [recently](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/15/federal-reserve-cuts-rates-to-zero-and-launches-massive-700-billion-quantitative-easing-program.html). My journey down the rabbit hole continued when I became aware of the Cantillon Effect...

<!-- ## Cantillon Effect -->

> _"The redistributive effects of money creation were called Cantillon effects by Mark Blaug after the Franco-Irish economist Richard Cantillon who experienced the effect of inflation under the paper money system of John Law at the beginning of the 18th century. Cantillon explained that The first ones to receive the newly created money see their incomes rise whereas the last ones to receive the newly created money see their purchasing power decline as consumer price inflation comes about."_ ([src](https://mises.org/library/how-central-banking-increased-inequality))

Those closest to the printing press will benefit. Everyone else, the overwhelming majority of the population, will suffer. When the market crashed in 2008 I graduated from University in Northern Ireland. Money was printed to bail out the banks. These private entities that enjoyed all the upside during the good times simply handed over the downside to the public. Privatize the gains, socialize the losses. Currencies like the British pound and the US dollar were heavily printed for this purpose. Inflation followed, as expected. I remember this [clip](https://twitter.com/Ben__Rickert/status/1247018945556570114?s=20) surfacing around that time. Now I understand a little better why this guy was so angry.

<!-- ## 21 million -->

How did Bitcoin help me to look at money through the lens of topics like scarcity, supply growth and the cantillon effect? As soon as I realized that Bitcoin was a radical experiment to create a new form of money; one that attempts to codify the properties of established forms of "sound money."

> _"A somewhat polemical term for a currency backed by a tangible commodity such as gold, silver or platinum... Many countries used sound money throughout most of their histories; however, most countries today use fiat money and have since the United States left the Bretton Woods System in the 1970s."_

When compared to fiat currencies, sound money dramatically holds its value for longer periods of time as it is backed by a scarce asset.

On January 3rd 2009, publicly verifiable code was executed for the first time to generate a new digital currency with a fixed supply schedule of 21 million. Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, chose this number as the limit and paired it with a system to programmatically create the coins over time.

Since then the network has been doing its thing in a distributed fashion, with no single point of failure. As I write this there is currently over 18 million Bitcoin in existence, and roughly every ten minutes the network autonomously generates some more - all in line with the schedule. There is a whole bunch of technical brilliance at play to ensure that the network stays functioning as intended, but all you need to know is that it works.

There is no central bank. Nor is there is lobbyists or politicians that can lean on the central bankers to influence the supply. The schedule is predetermined.

If you are thinking to yourself "What is stopping those who maintain and update the code from changing the supply schedule?" Good question. The answer is nothing. The figure of 21 million is a social contract of sorts. Satoshi released the [code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) with an open-source license that permits anyone to copy (or "fork") the innovation to create their own digital currency. Many have. A quick glance at the repository where the code is publicly hosted shows that it has been forked many thousand times. However it is the original vision for Bitcoin laid out by Satoshi that has gained the network effect and remains by far the most popular in terms of investment.

You may often hear enthusiasts emphasize that Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that is:

- permission-less
- censorship-resistant
- peer-to-peer
- Unseizable

<!-- ## A Hedge -->

While all of this is true, many of us (at least not yet) are not at risk of having our payments censored. Nor do we have problems getting permission to open a bank account. As much as I truly believe that the world needs a more open and censorship-resistant form of money, it is not something that I have personally needed. For me, I like to think of Bitcoin as a hedge against devaluation and failure of fiat currencies. It is an alternative. A way to opt-out of established forms of money. It is a bet of sorts, and one that could possibly be the greatest asymmetric opportunity in history.

> _"Optionality is the property of asymmetric upside (preferably unlimited) with correspondingly limited downside (preferably tiny)."_
> -- <cite>Nassim Nicholas Taleb</cite>

I feel this way because if history is anything to go by then it stands to reason that central banks will continue to find reasons to ramp up the printing of fiat currencies. Whether it is bailing out failed businesses or funding another war, the value of your savings is at the mercy of a small group of people with little to no oversight. These individuals determine the rate at which fiat currencies are printed, and to whom the fresh notes will be made available to first. I used to believe that institutions like governments and their cronies would do bad things because they were evil. As I have gotten older I feel that it is more often than not plain old incompetence. History is laden with many [examples](https://listverse.com/2012/12/26/10-fascinating-economic-collapses-through-history/) of failed currencies with inflation being the root cause.

When Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, was asked if the fed was "essentially flooding the system with money", he agreed and said:

By simply allocating a percentage of my savings into Bitcoin I like to think that I am purchasing an insurance policy. Some like to trade Bitcoin, I prefer to just hold for the long term. The short term price volatility of Bitcoin can be scary, but history has shown that those who simply acquire and hold Bitcoin for long periods tend to be rewarded. It is this reward for long-term thinking that powerfully contradicts the traditional system, and humanity is better for it.

Never forget that Bitcoin is still an experiment. It may fail. You should only ever invest a sum of money that you are willing to lose.
