# Bitcoin is for Artists

I fell down the Bitcoin rabbit hole in 2017. Before that I was singing songs for a living. I spent my time between New York, Nashville and Los Angeles chasing a dream. My goal for this post is to present what I feel is the most important knowledge I have gained since then. If I can provide a single fellow artist with a better understanding of the merits of Bitcoin I'll be happy.

<!-- ## Scarcity -->

Almost everyone is familiar with how the scarcity of an item will cause demand for it to increase, which will in turn cause the price to the same. Think of tickets for a sold-out concert as an example. Take a second to think of another example... Anyone think of currencies? I’m gonna guess not many of you did. If you asked me a few years ago I would have probably rhymed off 100 different items before even thinking about currencies. Bitcoin changed this for me. It changed how I think about fiat currencies.

<!-- ## Inflation -->

Let’s talk about Inflation… which can be defined as the ”quantitative measure of the rate at which the average price level of a basket of selected goods and services in an economy increases over a period of time” ([src](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp)). In other words, inflation is a measure of the decline in purchasing power of your currency over time. When I first visited New York is 2011 I recall that the price of an espresso at my favorite coffee shop was $2.25. I bought one a few weeks ago for $4.50. I can’t say for certain, but I’m pretty sure it would have almost been impossible to ask someone in 2011 New York to pay \$4.50 for a coffee. The reality is that a dollar is not worth as much as it was then. Thinking back to my high-school economics classes I have to say that this observation pretty much sums up what I knew about the phenomenon. However I didn't happen retain what the main causes of inflation are.

> _*“The consensus view among economists is that sustained inflation occurs when a nation's money supply growth outpaces economic growth.“ ([src](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp))*_

<!-- ## Supply -->

And who is responsible for a nations money supply growth? That would be the Central Banks. One way that Central Banks increase supply is via a process called Quantitative Easing (QE). “To execute quantitative easing, central banks increase the supply of money by buying government bonds and other securities." ([src](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quantitative-easing.asp)) In other words, QE is a fancy way of describing the process of printing money (increasing the supply) to purchase things like government debt. We saw this process begin all around the world as a response to the global financial crisis in [2008](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/24/the-fed-launched-qe-nine-years-ago--these-four-charts-show-its-impact.html). The process was ramped up again more [recently](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/15/federal-reserve-cuts-rates-to-zero-and-launches-massive-700-billion-quantitative-easing-program.html).

<!-- ## Cantillon Effect -->

My journey down the rabbit hole continued when I started researching a phenomenon known as the Cantillon Effect... "The redistributive effects of money creation were called Cantillon effects by Mark Blaug after the Franco-Irish economist Richard Cantillon who experienced the effect of inflation under the paper money system of John Law at the beginning of the 18th century. Cantillon explained that The first ones to receive the newly created money see their incomes rise whereas the last ones to receive the newly created money see their purchasing power decline as consumer price inflation comes about." ([src](https://mises.org/library/how-central-banking-increased-inequality))

In other words, those who are closest to the printing press will benefit the most. Everyone else, the overwhelming majority of the population, will lose. When the market crashed in 2008 I graduated from college in Northern Ireland. Money was printed to bail out the banks. Private entities that enjoyed all the upside during the good times simply handed over all of the downside to the public. Privatize the gains, socialize the losses. Currencies like the British pound and the US dollar were heavily printed. Inflation as you would expect, followed. I remember this [clip](https://twitter.com/Ben__Rickert/status/1247018945556570114?s=20) surfacing around that time. Now I understand a little better why this guy was so angry.

<!-- ## 21 million -->

So how did Bitcoin help me to look at money through the lens of topics like scarcity, supply growth and the cantillon effect? As soon as I realized that Bitcoin was a radical experiment to create a new form of money; one that in many ways codifies the properties of established forms of money like gold - Otherwise known as "sound money."

> "A somewhat polemical term for a currency backed by a tangible commodity such as gold, silver or platinum... Many countries used sound money throughout most of their histories; however, most countries today use fiat money and have since the United States left the Bretton Woods System in the 1970s."

On January 3rd 2009, publicly verifiable code was executed for the first time to generate the beginning of a new digital currency with a fixed supply schedule of 21 million. There is no central bank. Nor is there is lobbyists or politicians that can lean on the central bankers to influence the supply. The schedule is predetermined. There will only ever be 21 million units of Bitcoin printed, or to use the more technically correct term; mined.

Since then the network has been doing its thing in a distributed fashion, with no single point of failure. As I write this there is currently just over 18 million Bitcoin in existence, and roughly every ten minutes the network autonomously generates more - all inline with the schedule. There is a whole bunch of technical brilliance at play to ensure that the network stays functioning as intended, but all you need to know is that it works.

If you are thinking to yourself "What is stopping those who maintain and update the code from changing the hard-cap to a different number?" Good question, and the answer is nothing. The 21 million hard cap is a social contract of sorts. Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin chose this number as the limit and it was paired with a system and schedule to programmatically create the coins over time. The code was released under an open-source license so anyone can copy (or "fork") the innovation to create their own digital currency. Many have. A quick glance at the repository where the code is publicly hosted shows that it has been forked" many thousand times. However it is the original vision for Bitcoin laid out by Satoshi that has gained the network effect and remains by far the most popular in terms of investment.

You may often hear enthusiasts emphasize that Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that is:

- permission-less
- censorship-resistant
- peer-to-peer
- Unseizable

<!-- ## A Hedge -->

While all of this is true, many of us (at least not yet) aren't at risk of having our payments censored. Nor do we have problems getting permission to open a bank account. As much as I truly believe that the world needs a more open and censorship-resistant form of money, it is not something that I have personally needed. As such I don’t feel particularly comfortable speaking to that need. For me Bitcoin is a hedge. An alternative. A bet of sorts, and one that could possibly be the greatest asymmetric opportunity in history.

If history is anything to go by then it stands to reason that central banks will continue to find a reason to ramp up the printing of fiat currencies. Whether it is bailing out failed businesses or funding another war, the value of your savings is at the mercy of a small group of people. With little to no oversight they determine the rate at which fiat currencies are printed, and to whom the fresh notes will be made available to first. I used to believe that governments and their cronies would do bad things because they were evil. As I have gotten older I more often feel that it is plain old incompetence. History is laden with many [examples](https://listverse.com/2012/12/26/10-fascinating-economic-collapses-through-history/) of failed currencies, often caused by inflation.

When Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, was asked if the fed was "essentially flooding the system with money", he agreed and said:

> "There is no end to our ability to do that."

By simply allocating a small sum of your savings into Bitcoin I like to think that I am purchasing a reasonable insurance policy against fiat currency failure. It doesn't have to your currency, Bitcoin serves as an out for citizens of every country. Never forget that Bitcoin is an experiment. It may fail, and you should only invest a sum of money that you are willing to lose. If you decide to invest I can't stress enough the importance of thinking of your purchase as a long term investment. I say this because the short term price volatility of Bitcoin can be scary to a lot of people. History has shown that those who simply acquire and hold for long periods tend to be rewarded. It is this reward for saving that may be needed more than ever if the central bankers continue their own experiment.

Further reading I highly recommend:

- The Bitcoin white paper - Penned by Satoshi. Where I started, and so should you.
- The Bitcoin Standard - A great book that helped me understand the history of money.
- Antifragile - Where I learned about the idea of asymmetric opportunities.
